etchr lab Sketchbooks: 100% cotton, indie brand, offered in B5, to.

Moleskine watercolor sketchbook: widely available, affordable-ish – paper is not pure cotton though, so will dissolve when wetted more than once or twice. 

Leutchturm dotted A5 hardcover: available at many book stores. overall nice quality and features (eg sturdy covers that are still thin, numbered pages, two bookmarks). paper is okay enough for everyday writing. They also make a "120g" series, but needs to be ordered directly from their website and I dont illustrate my todo lists, so I don't really need that.

Sakura Quickie Glue: mostest mobile glue

Lefranc Bourgeois inks: small comes with dropper, large is affordable, works in fountain pen

Molotow custom twin pump 224/221. Needs a the brush tip of an 221 to create this most versatile marker. Large ink tank. Order some replacement tips tips with it.

Molotow dripstick small: in relation to sketchbook: ultrafat!

Pentel waterbrushes: unmatched by all the other waterbrushes

Pentel FP 10: just a great pen, bristles a bit longer than xy (which I like). There are hacks out there to make a standard converter fit, but it gets even better: grease the screwing thread and fill your ink of choice directly into the back end of the pen. works like a charm. (If there a re kids around, additionally taping the thread might prevent a messy accident)

Faber Castell Sketchbook satchel: keeps the handful of most used items on the book, all the rest goes into the...

Molotow Taschi: just love the format and cap-design. very affordable. sadly not the most durable, produces waste :/

Heavy duty compass: the school stuff kept falling apart so this is hopefully the last one I ever needed to buy. Holds any standard pencil. Made from stell, so really heave.

[Tamiya Masking Tape 10mm](https://www.amazon.de/-/en/300087031-Masking-Tape-10mm/dp/B0000WS000): endlessly re-attachable and keeps sharp edges. Like a model version of Frogtape. Besides the roll in the large bag, I keep a sheet of wax paper with strips in the backpocket of the sketchbook. Also available as refill to produce less plastic waste. 

Fountain pen

Pilot V5/V7. Perfect rollerball pen. Throwaway waste-producer, so I keep these only as a backup in case the fointain goes empty without a chance to refill it.

Flexible riler: actually a lightweight squigee.

Uni-ball signo white: works really well for the rare cases I want to go white-over-black, great opacity.

Olfa SAC-10: One of my most favourite tools ever. The 30 deg blades really make a difference (available as 10 pack as SAB-10).

[Rotating stapler](https://www.amazon.de/-/en/106501-Wedo-Swivel-Stapler/dp/B000TJYQIY/): great to make small booklets – especially when you have a duplex printer and using the Acrobat Reader booklet printing function.

~~Steadler Noris~~ As much as I love this classic: [varnish-free pencils](https://www.amazon.de/-/en/Students-Teacher-Supplies-Drawing-Writing/dp/B07PHF68GB/) are much better for you and the environment and Pentel makes great [Eraser Gaps](https://www.amazon.de/-/en/gp/product/B0091G8HZY/)

[Mobile sharpener](https://www.amazon.de/-/en/Faber-Castell-186999-Perfect-Pencil-Black/dp/B008OEI5K6/): Ridiculous idea to have this thing at the end of a pencil while writing. But it's the most portable sharpener with reservoir because sometimes there is no way to handle wood chips and since it has a clip it doesn't get lost in the bag.

A different kind of watercolor case: combine a [generic metal watercolor case](https://www.amazon.de/-/en/dp/B004RC0E3K/) with [epty watercolour pans](https://www.amazon.de/-/en/watercolour-plastic-palette-acrylic-painting/dp/B094H2HLBK/) and some [sticky magnets](https://www.amazon.de/-/en/Gauder-Magnetic-Plate/dp/B07L2G8355/) and voila
